# What is this?
This is a for-fun open sourced project written in Zig which downloads all (at the time) known Highlander 9v9 TF2 maps. Also my first Zig project.

# How do I use this?
Just run the program, it will locate your TF2 folder and download the maps to it.

# How can I build this myself?
1. Set up Zig
> https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/
2. Run the build command
> zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
